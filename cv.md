   I want to be a frontend developer. It is very important for me to take this course. I love learning everything new. New knowledge and skills always give a person more opportunities. I always achieve my goals, even if it requires more efforts. After all, everyone knows the fact that out of 100% of the completed work (spent time, efforts), only 20% brings the results.

  Today I don't have the required skills of programming and  code examples  but I think that this point of my resume will be supplemented soon.
 
  ####I graduated:
  *BSUIR with a degree in marketing and economics in 2008 (At th euniversity, we study C, C ++, Java, Html);
  *BSUIR Master in Economics 2009;
  *SEO courses, contextual advertising, Google analitics from Webcommedia 2010.
 
 I've completed a retraining course in English at MSLU. At the moment I do not use English in my work.
